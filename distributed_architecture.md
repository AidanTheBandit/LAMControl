# LAMControl Distributed Architecture Plan

## Overview
Transform LAMControl from a monolithic application to a distributed system with a central server and remote worker nodes.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Central LAMControl Server
- **Purpose**: R1 API gateway, LLM parsing, task orchestration
- **Location**: Can be hosted on cloud/VPS
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Receive prompts from R1
  - Parse prompts using GROQ LLM
  - Route tasks to appropriate workers
  - Aggregate responses
  - Provide admin dashboard

### 2. Worker Nodes
- **Purpose**: Execute specific integration tasks
- **Location**: User's local machines/devices
- **Types**:
  - **Browser Worker**: Web automation (YouTube, Gmail, Amazon, etc.)
  - **Computer Worker**: Local system control (volume, media, power)
  - **Messaging Worker**: Social media interactions (Discord, Telegram, Facebook)
  - **AI Worker**: OpenInterpreter and other AI tools

### 3. Communication Protocol
- **Method**: WebSocket + HTTP REST API
- **Security**: API keys, worker authentication
- **Features**: Real-time communication, task queuing, status updates

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
1. Create worker node framework
2. Implement task routing system
3. Setup worker discovery and registration
4. Create secure communication protocol

### Phase 2: Worker Implementations
1. Browser automation worker
2. Computer control worker
3. Messaging platform workers
4. AI/OpenInterpreter worker

### Phase 3: Enhanced Features
1. Load balancing across workers
2. Failover and redundancy
3. Advanced monitoring and logging
4. Worker auto-scaling

## Benefits
- **Scalability**: Add workers for specific needs
- **Security**: Sensitive operations stay on local machines
- **Flexibility**: Mix cloud server with local workers
- **Reliability**: Distributed failure handling
- **Performance**: Parallel task execution

## Use Case Example
```
R1 → "open youtube music and play weezer" 
→ Central Server (GROQ parsing) 
→ Browser Worker (local PC) 
→ Opens browser and navigates to YouTube Music
→ Response back to R1
```
